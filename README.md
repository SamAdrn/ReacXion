## Test your reaction timing

Here's a little game I made out of boredom.

Challenge your reaction skills. The point of the game is to click on the white area (seen in the GUI) or pressing the `ENTER` key, whenever the indicator turns green. You will have time to prepare after you start the game, but that time varies for different sessions to add a bit of challenge every time.

Don't spam your clicks though, that would be unfair.

The game also has a player management system, that allows you to compare your skills amongst your friends. Add new players, edit them, or delete them when you feel jealous, it's up to you.

To run the game, go to the [`main`](https://github.com/SamAdrn/ReacXion/blob/main/src/game/Main.java) class and run the `main()` method.

Go ahead and try it out!
