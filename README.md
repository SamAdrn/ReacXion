## Test your reaction timing

Here's a little game I made out of boredom.

Challenge your reaction skills. The point of the game is to click on the white area (seen in the GUI) or pressing the `ENTER` key, whenever the indicator turns green. You will have time to prepare after you start the game, but that time varies for different sessions to add a bit of challenge every time.

To cheaters, spamming your clicks won't work. Sorry.

For a little sense of competition, let your others try out the game as well. The game's player management system allows you to compare your skills amongst your friends. Add your friends to the database, edit them to ridiculous nicknames, or delete them if they're better than you. It's all up to you!

To run the game, go to the [`main`](https://github.com/SamAdrn/ReacXion/blob/main/src/game/Main.java) class and run the `main()` method.

Go ahead and try it out!
